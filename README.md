# 📚 Library Management System (Java)

A **console-based, menu-driven Library Management System** developed using **Core Java**.  
This project demonstrates the practical use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles,  
**Collections Framework**, **CRUD operations**, **Exception Handling**, and **switch-case** logic.

---

## 🔹 Project Overview

The Library Management System is designed to manage basic library operations such as adding books, viewing books, deleting books, managing members, and issuing books.  
The application runs entirely on the **console** and does not require a **GUI or database**.

This project is suitable for **academic evaluation**, **viva**, and **beginner-to-intermediate Java learning**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform **CRUD operations** on library data
- Implement a **menu-driven application** using switch-case
- Apply **Object-Oriented Programming concepts**
- Use **Java Collections (ArrayList)** for data storage
- Handle runtime errors using **custom exceptions**
- Write clean, readable, and well-documented code

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Programming Language: **Java**
- IDE: **Eclipse**
- Collections: **ArrayList**
- Input Handling: **Scanner**
- Version Control: **Git & GitHub**

## ⚙️ Features

### 📘 Book Management
- Add new books
- View all books
- Delete books
- Check book availability

### 👤 Member Management
- Add new members

### 🔄 Issue Management
- Issue books to members
- View issued book records

## 🔁 CRUD Operations Mapping

| Operation | Functionality |
|---------|---------------|
| Create | Add Book, Add Member |
| Read | View Books, View Issued Books |
| Update | Update book quantity during issue |
| Delete | Delete Book |

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used

- **Encapsulation** – Private variables with getters and setters  
- **Abstraction** – Service layer handling business logic  
- **Modularity** – Package-based project structure  
- **Reusability** – Utility and service classes  

---

## ⚠️ Exception Handling

The project uses **custom exception classes** to handle invalid scenarios:

- `BookNotFoundException` – When a book ID does not exist
- `MemberNotFoundException` – When a member ID is invalid
- `BookNotAvailableException` – When a book is out of stock

This ensures smooth program execution and meaningful error messages.
